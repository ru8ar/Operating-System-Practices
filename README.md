# Operating-System-Practices
This repository contains my personal study notes, exercises, and implementations related to **Operating Systems**.  
The projects are based on concepts and examples from books, university lectures, and online resources.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
- Basics of Operating Systems
  ...will continue




## ðŸš€ How to Run
Most of the examples are written in **C** and can be compiled with `gcc`.  
Some exercises may require additional libraries (e.g., `pthread`).  


## ðŸ“Œ Note

The projects in this repository are mainly implementations and practice work based on the exercises from the book  
[*Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)*](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/).

The original reference code and official projects can be found in the authors' repository:  
[ostep-code on GitHub](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-code/tree/master).
